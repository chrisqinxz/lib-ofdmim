1.  PRESENTATION
----------------

This library implements the optimal mapper of OFDM with Index Modulation (OFDM-IM). By optimal we mean the mapper can achieve, in practice, the maximal theoretical spectral efficiency (SE) of OFDM-IM under the same asymptotic constraints of the classic OFDM mapper. A requisite for SE maximization is deactivating the subblock partitioning in the symbol (i.e. setting the number g of subblocks to 1) and setting the number of activa subcarriers to half of the available subcarriers.

Our library implements all steps to map (decimal) data into frequency-domain complex baseband samples at the transmitter. Similarly, provided are steps to demap a frequency-domain complex baseband symbol into (decimal) data. Therefore, the OFDM-IM DSP blocks Index Selector (IxS), the M-ary mapping (for active subcarriers) and the Symbol Creation blocks are supported. The IxS block is implemented as callback to enable flexible inclusion of novel ranking/unranking algorithms.

2.  AUTHORS
----------------
This software was developed by Saulo Queiroz during his PhD under supervision of profs. Edmundo Monteiro and Joao P. Vilela.
If you find any bug, please, contact the author.

3. FUNCTIONALITIES OF INITIAL VERSION
-------------------------------------
* Bit to/from frequeny-domain OFDM-IM complex baseband samples

* Suported index selector (IxS) algorithms: 

   -> Combinadic unranking/ranking (referred to by the original OFDM-IM setup)

   -> Linear-time combinadic unranking/ranking 

* Supported constellations for active subcarriers: 

   -> IEEE 802.11 BPSK and QPSK

4. INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------
Basic C++ compiler is required.
Performing command "make" should build libraries and examples in lib/ and examples/, respectivelly.
Source codes are in src/.

5. HOW TO ADD YOUR OWN INDEX SELECTOR ALGORITHM
-----------------------------------------------
We provide users with generic methods to facilitate the implementation of nove novel index selector algorithms. They are listed below. The prototype of the methods are in the class UnRankingAlgorithmsCallBack in the file include/ixs.h which are implemented in the library src/ixs.c.

a) void thirdPartUnranking(TypeData X, int N, int k, TypeIndex* answer)
Replace the content of this method to your own implementation of unranking (index selector at the OFDM IM transmitter).
This method takes X in the range 0 to C(N,k)-1 and calculates the elements of the array answer[0..k-1] such that:
     X = C(answer[0], 1) + C(answer[1], 2) + C(answer[2], 3) + ... + C(answer[k-1], k).
Data types are defined in include/ixs.h.

b) TypeData thirdPartRanking(int N, int k, TypeIndex* indexesArray); 
Replace the content of this method to your own implementation of unranking (index selector at the OFDM IM receiver).
This method does the inverse of unranking: i.e. calculates the value of the integer X in [0, C(N,k)-1] given the array of indexes indexesArray.

For more details abount unranking/ranking and the Combinatorial Number System, please refer to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_number_system

After steps above, you can instantiate an IMMapper and set it to work with your algorithms as follows:
```c++
include <immapper.h>
...
main()
{
    IMMapper myMapper(64); //64-subcarrier mapper, k = 32. BPSK by default.
    // declaration of unrank and rank callback (pointer) variables 
    void (UnRankingAlgorithmsCallBack::*unrank)(TypeData, int, int, TypeIndex*);
    TypeData (UnRankingAlgorithmsCallBack::*rank) (int N, int k, TypeIndex* indexesArray);
    // assigning callback variables with a method of UnRankingAlgorithmsCallBack
    unrank = &UnRankingAlgorithmsCallBack::thirdPartUnranking;
    rank = &UnRankingAlgorithmsCallBack::thirdPartRanking;
    //setting the third-part IxS unranking/ranking algorithms to your own implementation
    myMapper.setIxSAlgorithm(unrank, rank);
    myMapper.setP1();
}
```

6. SUGGESTED TODO FROM THE INITIAL VERSION
-----------------------------------------
* Improve documentation and makefile
* The p1 bits are implemented as 64-bit variables. In the optimal setup (k=N/2), this gives symbols of at most N = 64 subcarriers. This is because the product in the multiplicative formula of C(N,k) produces very large numbers that require more than 64 bits if N>64 and the optimal setup is chosen (k=N/2). Future improvements may refer to techniques that avoid overflow of the multiplicative formula for N>64 eg. adoption of BigInt C++ library.
* Expand to higher order QAM constellations M>4.
* Support for sub-optimal spectral efficiency setups, g>1, k!=N/2.
* Support dual-mode OFDM-IM mapp (remark: this is just a matter of adding novel constellation diagrams in the MLUT class)
* Support multiple-mode OFDM-IM map
* Support for the remainder DSP steps: IFFT, Detection.
* Support for noise and channel simulation to compare different OFDM-IM algorithms
